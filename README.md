# Re-learning how to use VScode and git / Github.

I have used both VScode and git previously, but I had an 8-month break from both. I decided to try re-learn both with a more thorough approach.

## Goals

- Install VScode and familiarize basic usage of it.
- Install git and initialize a repository.
