# Re-learning how to use VScode and git / Github.

I have used both VScode and git previously, but I had an 8-month break from both. I decided to try re-learn both with a more thorough approach.

## Goals

- Install VScode and familiarize basic usage of it.
- Install git and initialize a repository.

## Progress

1. Downloaded and installed VScode.
2. Created workspace and customized setting for that space.
3. Installed extensions from VScode marketplace.
4. Downloaded and installed gitSCM.
5. Set up git and cloned this repository to VScode workspace.
6. In VScode, made changes, commit and push to master branch.
7. In VScode,  pulled master from remote origin.
8. In VScode, created a new branch and made changes to readme.

## Conclusion

Installed both Git and VScode. Set both softwares up and practised using them. Now I have basic knowledge of using them and I'm ready to start using them in my personal projects.
